User : Hello!
AI : Hi! How can I assist you today?
User : Can you explain what machine learning is?
AI : Machine learning is a subset of AI that allows systems to learn patterns from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed.
User : What are the types of machine learning?
AI : The three main types are supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.
User : Can you explain supervised learning?
AI : In supervised learning, the model learns from labeled training data to predict outcomes.
User : What about unsupervised learning?
AI : Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns or structures in data without labeled outcomes.
User : Is deep learning part of machine learning?
AI : Yes, deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers.
User : What are neural networks?
AI : Neural networks are models inspired by the human brain that can recognize patterns and make decisions.
User : What is a dataset?
AI : A dataset is a collection of data used for training or testing a machine learning model.
User : What is model training?
AI : Model training is the process where a machine learning algorithm learns from data.
User : What is overfitting?
AI : Overfitting happens when a model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on new data.
User : What is underfitting?
AI : Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data.
User : What is validation data?
AI : Validation data is used to tune the modelâ€™s parameters during training without using test data.
User : What is test data?
AI : Test data is used to evaluate the performance of the trained model on unseen data.
User : What is a feature?
AI : A feature is an individual measurable property or characteristic of the data.
User : What is a label?
AI : A label is the output or target value the model is trying to predict.
User : What is regression in ML?
AI : Regression is a type of supervised learning used to predict continuous values.
User : What is classification?
AI : Classification is a supervised learning task used to predict discrete categories or labels.
User : What is clustering?
AI : Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique used to group similar data points.
User : What is K-means?
AI : K-means is a popular clustering algorithm that partitions data into K distinct groups.
User : What is decision tree?
AI : A decision tree is a model that splits data based on feature values to make predictions.
User : What is random forest?
AI : A random forest is an ensemble of decision trees that improves prediction accuracy.
User : What is logistic regression?
AI : Logistic regression is a classification algorithm that estimates the probability of a binary outcome.
User : What is linear regression?
AI : Linear regression is a technique to predict a continuous value based on one or more features.
User : What is a confusion matrix?
AI : A confusion matrix shows the performance of a classification model using true/false positives/negatives.
User : What is accuracy?
AI : Accuracy is the ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total observations.
User : What is precision?
AI : Precision is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true and false positives.
User : What is recall?
AI : Recall is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives.
User : What is F1-score?
AI : F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
User : What is cross-validation?
AI : Cross-validation splits the data into subsets to train and validate the model multiple times.
User : What is a hyperparameter?
AI : A hyperparameter is a configuration that is set before training a model and not learned from data.
User : What is grid search?
AI : Grid search is a method to find the best hyperparameters by testing combinations.
User : What is gradient descent?
AI : Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function.
User : What is loss function?
AI : A loss function measures the difference between the predicted and actual values.
User : What is learning rate?
AI : Learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls how much the model updates in response to the loss.
User : What is batch size?
AI : Batch size is the number of samples processed before the model is updated.
User : What is an epoch?
AI : An epoch is one complete pass through the entire training dataset.
User : What is transfer learning?
AI : Transfer learning uses a pre-trained model on a new, related task.
User : What is reinforcement learning?
AI : Reinforcement learning involves learning by interacting with an environment to maximize rewards.
User : What is an agent in RL?
AI : An agent is the learner or decision-maker in reinforcement learning.
User : What is an environment in RL?
AI : The environment is the world the agent interacts with and receives feedback from.
User : What is a reward in RL?
AI : A reward is feedback given to the agent to evaluate its action.
User : What is Q-learning?
AI : Q-learning is a reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the value of actions in states.
User : What is policy in RL?
AI : A policy defines the agent's way of behaving at a given time.
User : What is exploration vs exploitation?
AI : Exploration is trying new actions; exploitation is using known actions that yield high rewards.
User : What is a convolutional neural network?
AI : A CNN is a deep learning model particularly effective for image data.
User : What is an RNN?
AI : A recurrent neural network (RNN) is good for sequence data like time series or text.
User : What is LSTM?
AI : LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of RNN designed to remember long-term dependencies.
User : What is activation function?
AI : Activation functions determine the output of a neural network node, like ReLU or sigmoid.
User : What is ReLU?
AI : ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is an activation function that outputs zero for negative inputs and linear for positive.
User : What is softmax?
AI : Softmax is an activation function that converts logits to probabilities.
User : What is dropout?
AI : Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly ignores neurons during training to prevent overfitting.
User : What is a learning curve?
AI : A learning curve shows how model performance improves over time or epochs.
User : What is TensorFlow?
AI : TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google.
User : What is PyTorch?
AI : PyTorch is an open-source deep learning framework developed by Facebook.
