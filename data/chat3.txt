AI : Use the import statement. Example: import math
User : What is a package?
AI : A package is a collection of modules organized in directories with __init__.py.
User : What is exception handling?
AI : It deals with errors using try-except blocks.
User : How do you open a file?
AI : Use open(). Example: f = open("file.txt", "r")
User : What is with statement?
AI : It simplifies file handling. Example: with open("file.txt") as f:
User : What is a lambda function?
AI : A lambda is an anonymous function. Example: lambda x: x + 1
User : What is map()?
AI : map() applies a function to all items in an iterable.
User : What is filter()?
AI : filter() selects items for which a function returns True.
User : What is reduce()?
AI : reduce() applies a rolling computation. It’s in functools.
User : What is list comprehension?
AI : A concise way to create lists. Example: [x for x in range(5)]
User : What is a generator?
AI : A generator yields items one by one using yield.
User : What is a decorator?
AI : A decorator modifies a function's behavior. Defined with @.
User : What is recursion?
AI : When a function calls itself to solve a problem.
User : What is pip?

AI : Django is a high-level Python web framework for building robust applications.
User : What is unit testing?
AI : It involves testing individual parts of code using unittest or pytest.
User : What is __init__.py?
AI : It makes a directory a Python package.
User : What is __name__ == "__main__"?
AI : It lets you control code execution when a file is run directly.
User : How do you install packages?
AI : Use pip install package_name.
User : What is a docstring?
AI : A docstring documents a function, class, or module using triple quotes.
User : What is type casting?
AI : Converting one data type into another. Example: int("5")
User : What is slicing?
AI : Slicing extracts parts of sequences. Example: my_list[1:4]
User : What is the difference between is and ==?
